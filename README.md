Project Title: Subscription Button Redesign Analysis

Description:
The objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of a redesigned subscription button on a subset of users compared to the previous design. The company aims to assess whether the new design increases the subscription rate by at least 3% without causing a decrease in subscriptions. This analysis will help determine whether the redesigned button is effective in attracting new subscribers while ensuring existing subscribers are retained.

Key Objectives:

Evaluate the performance of the redesigned subscription button compared to the previous design.
Determine if the new design increases the subscription rate by at least 3%.
Ensure that the new design does not result in a decrease in subscription rates.

Key Metric:

Click Through Rate (CTR)

Approach:

Find the appropiate sample size for the experiment.
Basis the sample size, randomly assign users to two groups: one group sees the old subscription button, while the other group sees the redesigned button.
Monitor the subscription rates for each group over a specified time period.
Analyze the subscription data to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in subscription rates between the two groups.
Calculate the percentage increase in subscriptions with the new button and compare it to the minimum threshold of 3% set by the company.
Assess any potential negative impacts of the new design on subscription rates.

Outcome : 
Our statistical tests have revealed that the new design is not doing a better job at attracting customers to become subscribers to our site than the old design. Although the new design is not necessarily losing us customers either, business leaders may consider if they would like to revert back to the old design, or continue to try other solutions to attempt to attract more subscribers.
